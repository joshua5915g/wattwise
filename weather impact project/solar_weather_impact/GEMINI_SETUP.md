# Gemini AI Integration Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Get Your Google Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Get API Key"** or **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy your API key (it looks like: `AIzaSyC...`)

## Step 2: Configure Streamlit Secrets

1. Create a `.streamlit` directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir .streamlit
   ```

2. Create a `secrets.toml` file inside `.streamlit/`:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   copy .streamlit\secrets.toml.template .streamlit\secrets.toml
   
   # On Mac/Linux
   cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.template .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```

3. Open `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyC..."
   ```

## Step 3: Install Google Gemini Package

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

## Step 4: Restart Streamlit

If Streamlit is already running, stop it (Ctrl+C) and restart:

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## What You'll See

Once configured, the dashboard will display:
- 🧠 **AI Energy Advisor** box at the top with witty, actionable recommendations
- The advice is generated by Google Gemini Flash based on:
  - Predicted solar efficiency
  - Current weather conditions
  - Time of day
  - Confidence intervals

## Example AI Advice

- "🌞 Stellar solar conditions! Perfect time to run energy-hungry appliances and show your utility company who's boss."
- "☀️ Solar panels are on fire today! Schedule that laundry marathon for 2 PM and watch those kilowatts flow."
- "☁️ Your panels are taking a siesta. Save the dishwasher duty for when the sun decides to show up around noon!"

## Troubleshooting

### No AI advice appears
- Check that `.streamlit/secrets.toml` exists and has your API key
- Verify the API key is correct (no extra spaces or quotes)
- Make sure you installed `google-generativeai` package

### API Rate Limits
- Gemini Flash is free with generous limits
- If you hit limits, the app will fall back to default advice
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for production use

## Security Note

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to version control!

Add to your `.gitignore`:
```
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

The template file is safe to commit for reference.
